# Registrador

A blockchain based land registry application. 


## The Network

It is a publically readable ledger on a peer to peer network of authorized government nodes who collectively add the verified blocks in consensus. 


## The Client

Anyone can run the client to verify the blocks. Any two parties can create and braodcast a land transaction using the client.


## What are decentralized apps

A decentralized application is an application that is run by many users on a decentralized network with trustless protocols. They are designed to avoid any single point of failure. They typically have tokens to reward users for providing computing power.


## What is blockchain

A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
